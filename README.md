Huffman Compression
Overview

Huffman compression is a widely used algorithm for lossless data compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This allows for efficient encoding of data by replacing frequently occurring characters with shorter codes and less frequent characters with longer codes.
